 ☐  @created(19-02-09 19:04) URL SPACE AS %20 WHY????
 PHP provides functions to convert to and from URL encoding, which allows you to build and decode URLs. There are actually two types of URL encoding, which differ in how they treat spaces. The first (specified by RFC 3986) treats a space as just another illegal character in a URL and encodes it as %20. The second (implementing the appli cation/x-www-form-urlencoded system) encodes a space as a + and is used in building query strings.
